the time has come, 
this file will have very poor grammar and will be written like a crazed manifesto


the following need to be completed in the reasonable future

Theme : style everything in a way that makes sense
Settings : allow users to change primitive Settings

now for the real stuff :
Custom nodes : a python script needs to be written in and parsed for ROS input (sub) and output (pub)
Node Tree View : all nodes, custom and canned need to be added to that menu; any node clicked on needs to be appened into the scene
GRDI file format : GRDI file will need to evolve to a zip file format, with the GRDI file itself being a point where all custom nodes are registered vaguely, but all of the expected python scripts are contained in a seperate folder
Console Window : grab the console on the bottom, vscode style, get access to a terminal!



future dream :
3D : incorperate threejs to create the 3D model for any robot
roslibjs : incorperate the roslibjs to listen to ROS messages being posted to topics, use this to create a debugger
Debugger : seperate "Tab" that contains all of the information, this could also be added to the design screen as a tab for the node picker




current bugfixes : 

fix issue with nodes being saved and having nothing in them, this is due to the custom nodes {} being saved with empty data first, fix pls
