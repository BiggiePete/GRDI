the time has come,
this file will have very poor grammar and will be written like a crazed manifesto

the following need to be completed in the reasonable future

Theme : style everything in a way that makes sense
Settings : allow users to change primitive Settings

now for the real stuff :
Custom nodes : a python script needs to be written in and parsed for ROS input (sub) and output (pub) !!
Node Tree View : all nodes, custom and canned need to be added to that menu; any node clicked on needs to be appened into the scene ! ADD FOLDERS
GRDI file format : GRDI file will need to evolve to a zip file format, with the GRDI file itself being a point where all custom nodes are registered vaguely, but all of the expected python scripts are contained in a seperate folder
Console Window : grab the console on the bottom, vscode style, get access to a terminal!

future dream :
3D : incorperate threejs to create the 3D model for any robot : the file format is called URDF and can be read about here : <https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch#Finishing_the_Model>
roslibjs : incorperate the roslibjs to listen to ROS messages being posted to topics, use this to create a debugger
Debugger : seperate "Tab" that contains all of the information, this could also be added to the design screen as a tab for the node picker

current goal for whenever :

- use snappy to re-construct python files on click (this will be usefull later)
- allow users to create custom message types, and those message types need to have their own colors (user selectable)
- settings, allow users to change the color palette for the node connections
- multiple file input
- node tree-view context menu
- remove the need for the one second delay after we recieve that a node is being processed, instead, make 2 event bus events for start and end, making call backs for either
